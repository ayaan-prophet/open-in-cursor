# Open in Cursor

> Open links to source code in Cursor.

This is a fork from the main project [Open-in-VSCode](https://github.com/aberonni/open-in-vscode) by [aberonni](https://github.com/aberonni).
It acheives exactly 2 things:
- Opens in Cursor instead of VS Code.
- Allows for Alt/Option + Click to open as a shortcut
